#I will take the simulation/empirical data from the Exchange_Rate/makemoments.jl file and compute transition paths, aggregate dynamicss after shocks

#first we will define the steady state objects 

# Then we will define the MIT shocks 

# Then we will define the transition path 

#Finally we will define the aggregate dynamics after shocks
